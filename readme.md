# Data-pipes, select functionality
This is an exploratory implementation of the *select* functionality for use in the [data-pipes](https://github.com/olange/data-pipes) project.

The *select* function applies the idea of a functional cursor to the DataNugget container. It lets its user create a reference to a path in a DataNugget. In other words, this allows one "to pass smaller sections from a larger nested collection to portions of an application, while maintaining a central point aware of changes". Our implementation relies on the [immutable-cursor](https://github.com/redbadger/immutable-cursor) library.

## Usage

Given a **DataNugget**, a **path** and a **callback**, the *select* function returns a **DataNugget/DataEgg** representing the data at the given path. We expect this newly created subset of the data to be able to notify mutations. To accomplish this, the *data* property is wrapped in an [immutable cursor](https://github.com/redbadger/immutable-cursor). The *callback* argument is passed to the cursor and signals its mutations.

The following example illustrates the usage of *select* to create a "view" pointing to the *scores* property of the first item of a *Person* list. The example also illustrates the manual creation of a DataNugget (a composite immutable data-structure representing a value and its schema). 

```javascript
// define a GQL formatted typedefs string
// with the exception that we use the "Data" type to define the entry point 
const typeDefs = `
  type Data {
    data: [Person]
  }
  type Person {
    name: String
    age: Int
    scores: [Int!]!
    friend: Person
  } 
`

// a plain js value conforming to previously defined typeDefsâ€¦
const valueJs = [
  {name:"Sonic", 
    age: 30,
    scores: [1, 2, 3],
    friend: { name: "Knuckles", age: 32, scores: [3, 2, 1], friend: null }
  },
  {name:"Mario", 
    age: 40,
    scores: [3, 2, 1],
    friend: null 
  } 
];

// construct a DataNugget with the value and schema 
const value = Immutable.fromJS(valueJs);
const schema = schemaFromTypeDefs(typeDefs);
const dataNugget = Immutable.Map({data:value, schema:schema});

// define a callback to signal mutations on dataEgg
const cb = (nextValue, prevValue, keyPath) => {
  console.log('Value changed from', prevValue, 'to', nextValue, 'at', keyPath);
};

const path = ['0','scores']; (())
const dataEgg = select(dataNugget, path, cb);

// modifications to the dataEgg are signalled by the execution of the callback
dataEgg.setIn(['data', '0'], 42);
  
```
